1. Primitive data structure is the data structure that allows you to store only single data type values. The non-Primitive data structure is a data structure that will enable you to store multiple data type values. integer, boolean, character, float, etc. are examples of primitive data structures.
2. Primitive types are stored directly in memory and have a fixed size.  The primitive data types in JavaScript include string, number, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol. The non-primitive data type includes the object.
3. Context lets components pass information deep down without explicitly passing props.
