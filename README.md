1. A **primitive data** structure allows you to store only single data type values. A non-primitive data structure enables you to store multiple data types. Integer, boolean, character, float, etc. are examples of primitive data structures.
2. **Primitive types** are stored directly in memory and have a fixed size.  The primitive data types in JavaScript include string, number, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol. The non-primitive data type consists of the object.
3. **Context** lets components pass information deep down in the component tree without explicitly passing props. This is useful when you want to pass data to a child component without passing it through intermediate components. ----- State Management
4. **fs.readfilesync** reads the file from the disk synchronously, blocking the other processes until the operation is finished. This method is useful when blocking the code execution is accepted e.g. in startup scripts.

6. Sychronous - In synchronous programming, operations are performed one after the other, in sequence. So, basically, each line of code waits for the previous one to finish before proceeding to the next.
